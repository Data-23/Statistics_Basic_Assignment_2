    "\n",
    "# The mean provides a measure of the central location of the data.\n",

    "# Definition: The median is the middle value when the values in a dataset are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data, making it a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers.\n",
    "# It is used when the dataset has non-symmetric distributions or when the central value is needed without the influence of extreme values.\n",
    "# The median provides a better representation of the \"typical\" value in a dataset with significant outliers or non-normal distribution.\n",

    "# It is also useful in identifying the most frequent value in a dataset.\n",
    "# The mode is not affected by outliers but might not provide a useful measure of central tendency if the dataset is very diverse with many unique values.\n",
    "# Comparison and Usage in Different Scenarios\n",
    "# Symmetric Distribution: For symmetric distributions without outliers, the mean, median, and mode are all approximately the same and provide a good measure of the central tendency.\n",
    "# Skewed Distribution: For skewed distributions, the median is often preferred because it is not influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "# Categorical Data: The mode is most useful for categorical data where you want to know the most common category.\n",
